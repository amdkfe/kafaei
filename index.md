Few years ago I designed a brand and modify the HTML/CSS codes of a pre-build e-commerce template of a family business online shop, a website that with online marketing (that’s done by myself) manages to generate about £250,000 in the last year.

I have also manged to launch my own start up, a unique review social network website in which people could recommend cool products to their friends and earn points and became expert...The idea itself, Its UI/UX is designed by myself via Adobe Photoshop, the coding were done by 3 programmers I hired to do the job( 2 back-end developers and one front-end developer)
After 3 years of building and destroying and building again with a little budget of my own, we managed to launch it about a year ago. I learned a lot about start ups, programming jargon and how to work and manage budget, programmers and the projects progress itself in this 3 years.
